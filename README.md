# Schrodinger

Solves the 1D time independent Schrodinger equation given an arbitrary potential and range of position values. Includes functions to calculate the momentum wavefunction, time evolve a stationary state, and decompose an arbitrary wavefunction into a superposition of stationary states. Also contains several potential functions, like a square well, asymmetric square well, and a square well with a barrier inside.
